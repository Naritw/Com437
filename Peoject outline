# 🔐 SecureAccess App

## 📘 Project Description  
SecureAccess is a mobile-first application designed to enhance physical and digital security for small to mid-sized organizations. It integrates proximity card authentication, secure login protocols, and real-time access monitoring to ensure only authorized users can access protected zones or resources.

## 🚨 Problem Addressing  
Organizations face increasing threats from unauthorized access and outdated authentication systems. SecureAccess solves this by:
- Replacing legacy access systems with proximity card and biometric verification.
- Implementing secure login protocols (2FA, input validation).
- Providing centralized dashboards for access monitoring and audit trails.

## 🧱 Platform  
- **Primary**: Android (Kotlin/XML)
- **Secondary**: Web dashboard (Power BI)
- **Tools Used**: Android Studio, Firebase, GitHub, Power BI
